Scala Practice Exercises 

Basic:

1. Write a Scala program to compute the sum of the two given integer values. If the two values are the same, then return triples their sum.  
2. Write a Scala program to get the absolute difference between n and 51. If n is greater than 51 return triple the absolute difference.  
3. Write a Scala program to check two given integers, and return true if one of them is 30 or if their sum is 30.  
4. Write a Scala program to remove the character in a given position of a given string. The given position will be in the range 0...string length -1 inclusive.  
5. Write a Scala program to find the larger value from two positive integer values in the range 20..30 inclusive, or return 0 if neither is in that range.

Strings:

6. Write a Scala program to calculate the sum of the numbers appear in a given string.
The given string is: it 15 is25 a 20string
The sum of the numbers in the said string is: 60
7. Write a Scala program to check if two given strings are rotations of each other:
Sample Output:
The given strings are: ABACD  and  CDABA
The concatination of 1st string twice is: ABACDABACD
The 2nd string CDABA  exists in the new string.
Strings are rotations of each other 
8. Write a Scala program to count and print all the duplicates in the input string. 
9. Write a Scala program to convert all the characters to lowercase, uppercase strings.
10. Write a Scala program to get a substring of a given string between two specified positions.

Arrays:

11. Write a Scala program to reverse an array of integer values using the same array.
12. Write a Scala program to find the common elements between two arrays of integers.
13. Write a Scala program to find the common elements between two arrays of strings.
14. Write a Scala program to get the difference between the largest and smallest values in an array of integers. The length of the array must be 1 and above.
15. Write a Scala program to find the two elements from a given array of positive and negative numbers such that their sum is closest to zero.

Lists:

16. Write a Scala program to remove single and multiple elements from a given list.
17.  Write a Scala program to iterate over a list to print the elements and calculate the sum and product of all elements of this list. 
18.  Write a Scala program to remove duplicates from a given list.
19.  Write a Scala program to get the difference between two given lists.	
20. Write a Scala program to check a given list is a palindrome or not.
